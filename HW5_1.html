Plot 1 – License Distribution by Type and Status
<iframe src="chart1.html" width="800" height="500" style="border:none;"></iframe>
This chart shows how many business licenses belong to each license type and how those licenses are separated by status. I used a stacked bar chart with nominal encoding for License Type on the x-axis and quantitative encoding for Count on the y-axis. Color represents the different license statuses (Active, Not Renewed, Inactive, etc.). I chose Altair's default categorical color scheme which provides distinct colors for each status, making it easy to compare across license types.
Before making the chart, I grouped the data by both License Type and License Status using groupby and counted how many records were in each category. This aggregation was necessary to get the totals for each combination.
The interactivity lets you click on items in the legend to filter the chart. When you click a license status in the legend, only that status is highlighted across all license types while others fade to 20% opacity. This helps you focus on comparing a specific status across different license types without visual clutter.

Plot 2 – Top 15 Counties by Number of Licenses

This chart shows the top 15 counties with the highest number of business licenses. I used a horizontal bar chart because it makes it easy to compare which counties have the most licenses. The x-axis shows the number of licenses (quantitative encoding) and the y-axis lists each county (nominal encoding). I used a simple blue color for all bars since there is only one category being displayed.
Before plotting, I grouped the data by County, counted the number of licenses in each one using groupby and size, and then selected the 15 counties with the highest totals using nlargest. This filtering makes the visualization cleaner and focuses on the most relevant data.
